## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No Claude directory found"**
- Ensure Claude Code CLI is installed and has been used at least once
- Check that `~/.claude/projects/` directory exists
- Manually set the Claude directory in extension settings

**Sessions not loading**
- Click "Refresh Sessions" in the panel
- Check if your Claude directory path is correct in settings
- Verify that JSONL files exist in your Claude projects folders

**Diffs not showing correctly**
- Ensure the files exist in your current workspace
- The extension tries to match files by relative path from project root
- For missing files, you'll be prompted to create them

**Performance issues with large history**
- The extension loads sessions incrementally with intelligent caching
- Search index is automatically compressed and optimized for large datasets  
- Use "Load More Sessions" to expand history as needed
- Clear project cache if experiencing slowdowns
- Rebuild search index if search performance degrades

**Search not returning expected results**
- Ensure search index has been built (automatic on first use)
- Try rebuilding the search index via "Refresh Sessions"
- Check search query syntax - supports partial matches and fuzzy search
- Clear search cache if results seem outdated

### Data Privacy
- **100% Local**: All data processing happens locally on your machine
- **No External Calls**: The extension never sends data to external servers
- **Read-Only by Default**: Only reads your existing Claude history files
- **Workspace Integration**: Only accesses your current VS Code workspace for file operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The extension is built with a modular architecture:

- **Data Layer**: JSONL parsers for reading Claude Code chat history
- **UI Layer**: Modern webview panels with GitHub-style interfaces
